# Genetic Algorithm vs DQN Algorithm for Scoring in Frostbite

This repo contains the code for both the genetic algorithm and DQN algorithm for learning
Frostbit in the OpenAi Gym environment. 

**Features**\
For both programs, renders and learns Frostbite. 

To run the genetic algorithm program:\
*python3 geneticFrostbite.py*

To run the DQN algorithm program:\
*python3 DQNFrogger.py*


**Dependencies**\
If any dependencies are required:\
*pip3 install [dependency]*
- numpy
- gym
- tensorflow
- atari_py

**Example Output**\
DQNFrogger.py:
